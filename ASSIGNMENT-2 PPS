Question-3(Unit-2)

Benitta is a School teacher. She has conducted n number of class tests to her students. For
the internal marks, she has to consider only the best two marks. Help her to automate the
process by writing a C program.

Solution :-

#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
   int n,i,a=0,b=0;
   scanf("%d",&n);
   int arr[n];
   for(i=0;i<n;i++){
       scanf("%d",&arr[i]);
       if(arr[i]>a){
          b=a;
          a=arr[i];
       }
   }    
   printf("%d %d",a,b);
   return 0;
}

Question-6(Unit-2)

Mala is studying G-VII. Her class teacher asked her to identify the type of triangle.
But she doesn’t know the concept of triangle types. Can you help her to identify the triangle
types based on the values of sides given to mala.
Hint:
a. If all the sides are equal then it is an Equilateral Triangle
b. If two sides are equal then it is a Isosceles Triangle
c. If no sides are equal then it is a Scalene Triangle

Solution :-

#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
int arr[3]:
int 1;
for (i-0;i<3;i++){
scan ("*d",&arr[i]):
)
1f(arr[0]=-arr[1]&&arr[1]=-arr[2]){
print ("Equilateral Triangle"):
else if(arr[0]--arr[1]||arr[1]--arr[2]||arr[0]=-arr[2]){
print ("Isosceles Triangle"):
)
elsef
printf ("Scalene Triangle");
)
return 0;

Question-1(Unit-3)

Stefi is an intern in a Software Company. She finds it difficult to work on strings. She needs
your help in one of her works in which she has to find the first and last occurrence of a given
character in a string.

Solution :-

#include <stdio.h>
void main()
{
    int i, count = 0, pos1, pos2;
    char str[50], key, a[10];
 
    printf("enter the string\n");
    scanf(" %[^\n]s", str);
    printf("enter character to be searched\n");
    scanf(" %c", &key);
    for (i = 0;i <= strlen(str);i++)
    {
        if (key == str[i])
        {
            count++;
            if (count  == 1)
            {
                pos1 = i;
                pos2 = i;
                printf("%d\n", pos1 + 1);
            }
            else 
            {
                pos2 = i;
            }
        }
    }
    printf("%d\n", pos2 + 1);
}

Question-18(Unit-3)

You have been given 3 integers - l, r and k. Find how many numbers between l and r
(both inclusive) are divisible by k. You do not need to print these numbers, you just have
to find their count.

Solution :-

#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int l,r,k,T=0;
    scanf("%d %d %d",&l,&r,&k);
    for(int i=1; i<=r; i++){
        if(i%k == 0){
           T++;
        }
    }
    printf("%d",T);
    return 0;
}
